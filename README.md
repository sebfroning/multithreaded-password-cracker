### Usage

`crack <threads> <keysize> <target>`


### Description

`crack` should attempt to find the password associated to the target DES
hash. It does this by trying all possible lowercase alphabetic (a-z)
passwords of length up to `keysize`. The program should run with
`threads` concurrent threads for speed.

Linux/Unix user passwords are never stored on the system. Instead, a
function called a hash is applied to the password. Then, the hashed
password is stored, traditionally in /etc/passwd or more recently in
/etc/shadow. The classic hash function on Unix systems is crypt(3). To
make things harder on crackers, crypt also uses a two character string
called a salt which it combines with the password to create the hash.
Schematically:

`password + salt => crypt() => hash`

The salt is visible in the hash as the first two characters. As an
example, a password `'apple'` and salt `'na'` become the hash
`'na3C5487Wz4zw'`.

The crack program should extract the salt from the first two characters
of target, then repeatedly call `crypt()` using all possible passwords
built of up to `keysize` lowercase alphabetic characters. For example,
if the given `keysize` is four then your program would iterate over all
strings `'aaaa', 'aaab', 'aaac', ..., 'zzzz'` looking for one that
hashes to the given input. If a match is not found, it would also look
through all strings of length less than `keysize`.

When a match to `target` is found, the program should print the cracked
password and exit immediately. If the entire space of passwords is
searched with no match, the program should exit with no output.
